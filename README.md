## Overview

rbapp is a ([thor](http://github.com/wycats/thor) & bundler based) ruby console application generator. You get a dependency with thor, but I think the pros wins the cons:

- Your ruby app gets a neat console API: arguments, options,and help for free.
- Your app is modular and easy to extend: only add new thor tasks!
- Your app get gets a simple but powerfull template based generator.
- Your app is generated as a bundle based gem, so you get easy deployment



 Of course, rbapp was generated by rbapp!

## Install & Use

To install:

    gem install rbapp

For use:

    rbapp myapp
    => generate an application named myapp in ./myapp dir

    rbapp myapp --sample

    => generate also a sample task

    rbapp --help

    => show options

# Help


Your generated app is a [thor](http://github.com/wycats/thor) "clone", so read [thor](http://github.com/wycats/thor) docs to get help about how create new tasks for your app.
rbapp is a very simple application: Read the source for better understanding: rbapp is it self rbapp generated, so it can show how your app works.
